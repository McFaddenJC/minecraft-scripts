The sun.. has gone... to bed and so must I... the server says goodnight
The moon is up, its getting late, let's get ready to celebrate.  It's Pajama Time!
I have been running this world all day and now I must sleep
May you be safe from the ghost under your bed...
Out of order. See you again soon.
I am being kidnapped by a comforter, sheet and pillow! No need to call the police, I will be released by morning!
Sleep mode, activate.
Roses are red, violets are blue. I'm going to sleep and so should you
Goodnight! Sleep tight. Don't let the bed bugs bite.
Exit light... Enter night... Grain of sand.... off to never never land...
Hasta la vista... players.
How did it get so late so soon?
The hardest thing you'll ever learn is how to say goodnight...
Parting is such sweet sorrow...
See ya later alligator.
Farewell, good thief. I wish to part in friendship, and would take back my words at the gate.
Party on dudes... Just not here.
Farewell and be excellent to each other.
That's all folks.
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. Like going to bed now.
Little by little, one travels far. But no further tonight.
I will not say, do not weep, for not all tears are an evil.
Mischief managed.
It’s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don’t keep your feet, there’s no knowing where you might be swept off to. Like bed.
I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could have all been killed... or worse, expelled. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.
Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope.
Do. Or do not. There is no try. Go to sleep.
Go to sleep. This is the way.
Fear is the path to the dark side. So is staying up all night.
It’s not my fault. It's just bedtime.
In my experience there is no such thing as luck. But there is such a thing as bedtime.
It’s a trap! Just kidding. It's just time for bed.
Your eyes can deceive you. Don’t trust them. Just go rest them.
Stay on target. And go to bed.
If you'll not be needing me, I think I'll shut down for a bit.
