The sun.. has gone... to bed and so must I... the server says goodnight
The moon is up, its getting late, let's get ready to celebrate.  It's Pajama Time!
I have been running this world all day and now I must sleep
May you be safe from the ghost under your bed...
Out of order. See you again soon.
I am being kidnapped by a comforter, sheet and pillow! No need to call the police, I will be released by morning!
Sleep mode, activate.
Roses are red, violets are blue. I'm going to sleep and so should you
Goodnight! Sleep tight. Don't let the bed bugs bite.
Exit light... Enter night... Grain of sand.... off to never never land...
Hasta la vista... players.
How did it get so late so soon?
The hardest thing you'll ever learn is how to say goodnight...
Parting is such sweet sorrow...
See ya later alligator.
Farewell, good thief. I wish to part in friendship, and would take back my words at the gate.
Party on dudes... Just not here.
Farewell and be excellent to each other.
That's all folks.
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. Like going to bed now.
Little by little, one travels far. But no further tonight.
I will not say, do not weep, for not all tears are an evil.
Mischief managed.
It’s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don’t keep your feet, there’s no knowing where you might be swept off to. Like bed.
I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could have all been killed... or worse, expelled. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.
Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You’re my only hope.
Do. Or do not. There is no try. Go to sleep.
Go to sleep. This is the way.
Fear is the path to the dark side. So is staying up all night.
It’s not my fault. It's just bedtime.
In my experience there is no such thing as luck. But there is such a thing as bedtime.
It’s a trap! Just kidding. It's just time for bed.
Your eyes can deceive you. Don’t trust them. Just go rest them.
Stay on target. And go to bed.
If you'll not be needing me, I think I'll shut down for a bit.
I think we're going to need a bigger boat!
Juse because you're bad guy... doesn't mean you're bad... guy.
You get to drink from the fire hose!
Ray! When someone asks you if you're a server admin, you say YES!
Log off, I gotta tell you about the twinkie!
Are you the keymaster?
Nobody steps on a church in my town!
Shutting down due to technical difficulties... what did you do Ray?
What does this button do?
I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that.
Components? American components, Russian components, ALL MADE IN TAIWAN!
The price is wrong Bob!
It tastes like…burning.
Lisa's bad dancing makes my feet sad.
And I want a bike and a monkey and a friend for the monkey.
Look Big Daddy, it's regular Daddy.
When I grow up, I want to be a principal, or a caterpillar!
My cat’s breath smells like cat food.
That's where I saw the Leprechaun. He tells me to burn things.
All of my friends have birthdays this year!
I drink blue juice from under the sink!
And the doctor told me that both my eyes were lazy, and that's why it was the best summer ever.
I'm a Star Wars.
My grandma had hair like that when she went to sleep in her forever box.
Wait, mister. You're drinking a candle. You don't want wax in your mouth, do you?
This is my swing set. This is my sandbox. I'm not allowed to go in the deep end.
Hi Super Nintendo Chalmers, I'm learneding.
I’m wearing a bathrobe, and I’m not even sick.

Miss Hoover, I glued my head to my shoulders.
In 50 years, the vacuum cleaner will be quiet and not scary.
Was President Lincoln okay?
I wanna go back in mommy!
Me fail English...That's unpossible.
If mommy's purse didn't belong in the microwave, why did it fit?
I'm in danger.
Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours.
Fireworks make my ears yell!
I cheated wrong. I copied the Lisa name and used the Ralph answers.
The doctor said I wouldn't have so many nose bleeds if I kept my finger outta there.
Why do people run away from me?
Martin Luther King had a dream. Dreams are where Elmo and Toy Story had a party and I was invited. Yay! My turn is over!
My daddy's gonna put you in jail.
Clouds are God's sneezes!
Daddy, I’m scared. Too scared to wet my pants.
Candles taste like burning.
Dear Miss Hoover, you have Lyme disease. We miss you. Kevin is biting me. Come back soon. Here's a drawing of a spirokeet. Love Ralph.
And when the doctor said I didn’t have worms any more, that was the happiest day of my life.
